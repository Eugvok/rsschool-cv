### Code example:

>Write a function that takes an integer as input, and
>returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.
>You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

``` 
var countBits = function(n) {  
	let x=''; //string 4 n conversation  
	let c=0;  // bit count  
	var arr = new Array();  
	x = (n).toString(2); //convert from decimal to binary string  
	arr = Array.from(x); //convert binary string to array of numbers  
	for (i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {if(arr[i]==1) {c++;}}  
	return c;  
}  
```
