### About me:

Interested in web development. I expect to eventually master the full stack,
but I see the frontend as the main direction of my development. 
  + Strengths: 
      - stress resistance  
      - negotiations  
      - time management  
      - teamwork  

I really like the possibility of remote work, which allows you to carry out professional growth <br> 
depending on my talents, abilities and practice, not according to some other criteria + nice comunity.
